    <h1>1. Grid Template Columns & Rows</h1>
    <p>
        Di sini kita akan mengenal 2 properties paling basic dari display grid, yaitu grid-template-columns dan grid-template-rows.
        Kedua property ini merupakan property dari grid container, jadi diaplikasikannya pada containernya, bukan pada grid item.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kegunaan dari kedua properties ini adalah untuk menciptakan grid-tracks yang sifatnya vertical dan horizontal.
        Tracks yang vertical disebut juga dengan Columns, dan Tracks yang horizontal disebut juga dengan Rows.
        Dengan kombinasi dari grid-template-columns dan grid-template-rows, kita bisa menciptakan petak-petak seperti pada milimeter-block
        untuk menggambar sebuah blue-print.
    </p>

    <h2>1.1. Contoh basic membuat grids dengan ukuran 5 x 2</h2>
    <p>
        Di contoh ini  kita melihat contoh sederhana 5 x 2 dengan ukuran yang berbeda untuk setiap columns dan rows.
        Seperti biasa kita bisa mengatur ukuran dengan menggunakan metric unit (px, em, pt, dan lain sebagainya).
        Atau kita juga bisa menggunakan auto untuk secara otomatis menempati sisa ruang dari containernya.

            CELL 1: A phone rings and text appears on the screen: "Call trans opt: received. 2-19-98 13:24:18 REC: Log>" As a conversation takes place between Trinity 
            (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Cypher (Joe Pantoliano), two free humans, a table of random green numbers are being scanned and individual numbers selected, 
            creating a series of digits not unlike an ordinary phone number, as if a code is being deciphered or a call is being traced.

            Agent Brown (Paul Goddard), and Agent Jones (Robert Taylor). Agent Smith and the presiding police lieutenant argue. 
            Agent Smith admonishes the policeman that they were given specific orders to contact the agents first, for their protection. 
            The lieutenant dismisses this and says that they can handle "one little girl" and that he has two units that are bringing her down at that very moment. 
            Agent Smith replies: "No, Lieutenant. Your men are already dead."

            Trinity makes a daring leap across an alley and through a small window. She has momentarily lost her pursuers and makes it to a public phone booth 
            on the street level. The phone begins to ring. As she approaches it a garbage truck, driven by Agent Smith, careens towards the phone booth. 
            Trinity makes a desperate dash to the phone, picking it up just moments before the truck smashes the booth into a brick wall. The three Agents reunite 
            at the front of the truck. There is no body in the wreckage. "She got out," one says. The other says, "The informant is real." "We have the name of

            Notices about a manhunt for a man named Morpheus scroll across his screen as he sleeps. Suddenly Neo's screen goes blank and a 
            series of text messages appear: "Wake up, Neo." "The Matrix has you." "Follow the White Rabbit." Then, the text says "Knock, knock, 
            Neo..." just as he reads it, a knock comes at the door of his apartment, 101. It's a group of ravers and Neo gives them a contraband disc 
            he has secreted in a copy of "Simulacra and Simulation." The lead raver asks him to join them and Neo demurs until he sees the tattoo of a

            they are watching him and that she knows that he is searching for answers, particularly to the most important question of all: what is the Matrix?

            Back at his bleak cubicle Neo receives a delivery as "Thomas Anderson." Upon opening the package he finds a cellphone which immediately rings. 
            On the other end is Morpheus, who informs Neo that they've both run out of time and that "they" are coming for him. Morpheus tells him to slowly look up, 
            toward the elevator. Agents Smith, Jones, and Brown are there, obviously looking for him, as a woman points towards Neo's cube. Morpheus tries to 
            guide Neo out of the building but when he is instructed to get on a scaffolding and take it to the roof Neo rejects Morpheus' advice, allowing

            Agent Smith asks him to help them capture Morpheus, considered a dangerous terrorist, in exchange for amnesty. Neo gives them the finger 
            and asks for his phone call. Mr. Smith asks what good is a phone call if he's unable to speak. Neo finds that his lips have fused together. 
            Panicked, he is thrown on the interrogation table by the Agents and they implant a shrimp-like probe, a bug, in his stomach, entering through his navel.

        Apabila kita menggunakan 1 fraction untuk 5 items, itu artinya satu bagian akan terbagi menjadi 5 bagian sama rata.

        Kita juga bisa menggunakan grid-row-start dan grid-row-end untuk menentukan sebuah item akan ditempatkan dari garis row mana ke mana.
    </p>

        Di lain sisi kita juga bisa menggunakan short-hand notation property untuk mempersingkatnya:
        grid-column adalah gabungan dari grid-column-start dan grid-column-end.
        grid-row adalah gabungan dari grid-row-start dan grid-row-end.

            Agent Smith admonishes the policeman that they were given specific orders to contact the agents first, for their protection. 
            The lieutenant dismisses this and says that they can handle "one little girl" and that he has two units that are bringing her down at that very moment.

    <h2>2.3. Grid Auto Column & Row</h2>
    <p>
        Grid auto column & row adalah properti yang bisa dimanfaatkan sebagai alternative juga, apabila developer belum bisa planning hasil akhir design
        atau masih brain-storming design yang hendaknya dibuat dia, sehingga designer atau front-end developer bisa mencoba-cobanya terlebih dahulu.
        (bagus untuk prototyping)
    </p>
    <p>
        grid-auto-column dan grid-auto row adalah membuat besaran satu cell dengan lebar dan tingginya, lalu seluruh cell akan digenerate secara otomatis 
        dengan besar cell yang sama persis (jadi persis seperti milimeter block). Selanjutnya yang perlu dilakukan designer atau developer hanya
        micro manage setiap grid-item.

    <h2>3. Grid Template Areas</h2>
    <p>
        Grid Template Areas adalah cara alternative membuat sebuah grid dengan menggunakan template. Dengan menggunakan properties
        grid-template-areas, kita mendefine sekumpulan cells atau sebuah cell dengan secara literal menulis gambar pemetaan template
        dari grid kita.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note!: contoh dibawah ini extreme pada code htmlnya, karena satu area memiliki banyak element.
        Pembuatan area seperti dibawah ini hanyalah untuk contoh, sehingga kalian dapat memahami betul cara kerja grid-template-areas.
        Bisa dilihat CELL 1 dan CELL 3 akan hilang karena ketimpa oleh CELL 5. Semua area hanya mendapatkan cell terakhirnya saja.
        Semua item bisa saling menimpa pada satu cell secara bersamaan, ini tidak hanya pada areas, tapi pada penempatan grid-column dan grid-row juga.
    </p>
    <div id="container-area" class="grid-container">
        <div class="grid-item header">CELL 1</div>
        <div class="grid-item side-bar">CELL 2</div>
        <div class="grid-item header">CELL 3</div>
        <div class="grid-item side-bar">CELL 4</div>
        <div class="grid-item header">CELL 5</div>
        <div class="grid-item footer">CELL 6</div> 
        <div class="grid-item footer">CELL 7</div>
        <div class="grid-item footer">CELL 8</div>
        <div class="grid-item body">CELL 9</div>
        <div class="grid-item body">CELL 10</div>
        <div class="grid-item body">CELL 11</div>
        <div class="grid-item body">CELL 12</div>                                  
    </div>

    <p>
        Contoh di bawah ini sama persis dengan yang sebelumnya, tetapi pada contoh ini ketimbang menggunakan grid-template-areas, kita menggunakan
        grid-template, yaitu short-hand notationnya.
    </p>
    <div id="template-area" class="grid-container">
        <div class="grid-item header">Header</div>
        <div class="grid-item side-bar">Side Bar</div>

        <div class="grid-item body">Body</div>                             
    </div>

    <h1>4. Gap, Justify Position, dan Align Position</h1>
    <p>
        Section kali ini akan membahas mengenai pembuatan jarak antar grid-item, sehingga kita tidak akan menggunakan margin untuk menciptakan gap.
        sekaligus kita akan melihat bagaimana cara membuat horizontal justification dan vertical alignment antar item apabila adanya berbedaan size dan
        gap di antara komponen-komponen itu.
    </p>

    <h2>4.1. Grid Gap</h2>
    <p>
        Grid Gap adalah properties yang digunakan untuk mengatur jarak/gap/margin antar item pada lines yang ada.

            CELL 9: At his job at Metacortex, a leading software company housed in an ominous high rise, Neo is berated by his boss for having a problem with authority, 
            for thinking he's special. Neo listens to his boss, but his attention is on the persons cleaning the window of the office. 
            Back at his bleak cubicle Neo receives a delivery as "Thomas Anderson." Upon opening the package he finds a cellphone which immediately rings. 
            On the other end is Morpheus, who informs Neo that they've both run out of time and that "they" are coming for him. Morpheus tells him to slowly look up, 
            toward the elevator. Agents Smith, Jones, and Brown are there, obviously looking for him, as a woman points towards Neo's cube. Morpheus tries to 
            guide Neo out of the building but when he is instructed to get on a scaffolding and take it to the roof Neo rejects Morpheus' advice, allowing 
            himself to be taken by the Agents.

            CELL 10: In an interrogation room the Agents confront Neo. They've had their eye on him for some time. He lives a dual existence: one life as Thomas A. Anderson, 
            a software engineer for a Metacortex, the other life as Neo, a computer hacker "guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for." 
            Agent Smith asks him to help them capture Morpheus, considered a dangerous terrorist, in exchange for amnesty. Neo gives them the finger 
            and asks for his phone call. Mr. Smith asks what good is a phone call if he's unable to speak. Neo finds that his lips have fused together. 
            Panicked, he is thrown on the interrogation table by the Agents and they implant a shrimp-like probe, a bug, in his stomach, entering through his navel.

    <h2>4.2. Justify</h2>
    <p>
        Justify adalah suatu tindakan yang mengatur pemerataan sebuah item secara horizonal, atau bisa dikatakan juga
        horizontal justification. Kita bisa menjustify 3 hal pada grid, yaitu content, item dan self.
    </p>
    <p>
        justify-content artinya kita mengatur seluruh posisi horizontal dari badan grid.
        justify-item artinya kita mengatur seluruh posisi horizontal dari item di dalam cell.
        justify-self artinya kita mengatur satu posisi horizontal dari item di dalam cell.
